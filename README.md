ðŸŒŸ What I Built:
âœ… Login & Authentication System â€” Secure player registration/login with file I/O
âœ… Leaderboard (Min-Heap) â€” Top 10 players tracked & updated dynamically
âœ… Matchmaking (Priority Queue) â€” Competitive pairing based on player scores
âœ… Friend System (Array + Linked List + Hash Table) â€” Add/search friends, manage connections
âœ… Save/Resume Game (Linked List + File I/O) â€” Save progress + continue later
âœ… Inventory (AVL Tree) â€” Fast theme selection + management via balanced tree
âœ… Multiplayer Mode â€” Shared board with real-time interaction + collision rules
âœ… Power-up System â€” Stackable bonuses + dynamic scoring
âœ… Interactive Menus â€” Start, levels, leaderboard, and end-game options

âš™ Data Structures Implemented:
ðŸ”¹ Linked List â€” Save tiles, friends, match history
ðŸ”¹ Min-Heap â€” Top 10 leaderboard
ðŸ”¹ Priority Queue â€” Matchmaking
ðŸ”¹ Hash Table â€” Quick player search
ðŸ”¹ Array (Dynamic) â€” Player profiles
ðŸ”¹ AVL Tree â€” Inventory / theme management

ðŸ’¡ Tech Stack:
C++ | SFML | Pure custom data structures | File handling

This project was a great opportunity to apply theoretical DSA concepts in a real-world gaming scenario, strengthen problem-solving skills, and work on clean system design.
